## 561. Array Partition I

Given an array of **2n** integers, your task is to group these integers into **n** pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```

**Note:**

1. **n** is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
2. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

思路:

* 把数组进行升序排序后,其排序后的奇数位之和就是其输出要求

```python
def arrayPairSum(nums):
    return sum(sorted(nums)[::2])
```
